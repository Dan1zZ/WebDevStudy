		<p class="news">Born to a Greek father and a South African-born Ukrainian-Jewish mother (Renee Hirschon), Philippakis lived in Greece until he was 4 years old when his family moved to South Africa. After living there for a year, his parents divorced and his mother moved with him and his brother to Oxford, England; his father left and went back to live in Greece. Every summer Philippakis would visit his father in Olympos on the Greek island Karpathos. His father played a significant role in his life regarding music, teaching him traditional Greek songs. Philippakis was raised in the Greek Orthodox religion.</p>
		<p>Philippakis was educated at Magdalen College School. There he had met all of the requirements for an assisted place at Magdalen, where he had taken classes on French, literature, and art. While attending school, Philippakis faced many difficulties due to his father's absence; he would get into trouble with the teachers and was ill-tempered. This led to his being suspended twice. Philippakis then went on to study English Literature at St John's College, Oxford; he dropped out before completing his degree to focus on the band.</p>
		<p>Philippakis formed Foals in 2005 with friend and former Youthmovies frontman Andrew Mears after the break-up of his former band The Edmund Fitzgerald, which also featured his Foals bandmate, drummer Jack Bevan.</p>
